## About the Project
The Democracy Chamber App is designed to promote constructive, open political discussions, encouraging community-based debate. Users can express opinions, share insights, and contribute to civic engagement initiatives.

This app provides a safe and inclusive space for discussing complex social issues, aligned with principles of democratic governance and active citizen participation.

## Key Features
- **Discussion Threads:** Users can create threads to present opinions on various topics. Other users can vote on whether they agree or disagree with the statement, and they can also share their thoughts.
- **Policymaker Polls:** Policymakers can create invite-only polls on specific topics to gather insights from targeted demographics. The app integrates with [Pol.is](https://pol.is), a platform that uses data analysis and AI to provide data-driven insights on public opinion for critical issues.
- **Anonymous Participation:** Users participate in discussions anonymously.
- **Community Moderation:** Discussions are maintained respectfully through community-based moderation tools.
